## How to define the required Node.js version in package.json?

> To specify the required Node.js version for your project in package.json, you can use the engines field. This field tells anyone installing your package (or running your app) which versions of Node.js are compatible with your project.
**Syntax**
```json
engines: {
   "node": "> or < =version_number",
   "npm": "> or < =version_number"
 }
```
**For examples**
```json
  "engines" : { 
    "npm" : ">=8.0.0 <9.0.0",
    "node" : ">=16.0.0 <17.0.0"
  }
```
